Swerve library based on: (with modifications/refactors)
* [HuskieRobotics/3061-lib](https://github.com/HuskieRobotics/3061-lib)
* [Mechanical-Advantage/SwerveDevelopment](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/SwerveDevelopment)
* [Team364/BaseFalconSwerve](https://github.com/Team364/BaseFalconSwerve)
* [REVrobotics/MAXSwerve-Java-Template](https://github.com/REVrobotics/MAXSwerve-Java-Template)

Motor communication is abstracted through [SwerveModuleIO](./SwerveModuleIO.java) and implementations for physical/sim hardware
